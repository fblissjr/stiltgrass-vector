FOREST SERVICE ROADS IN BUNCOMBE
---------------------------------
FS 74  - Big Ivy Road (multiple segments, total ~8.4 mi)
FS 479 - Bent Creek Gap Road (multiple segments, total ~4.5 mi)
FS 480A - Bent Creek Trail (1.86 mi)
FS 479F - Boyd Branch Road (1.71 mi + 0.47 mi)
FS 479G - Laurel Branch Road (0.94 mi)
FS 231 - Lower Staire (0.45 mi)

Total: 14 FS road segments in Buncombe County

PROMISING CANDIDATES
--------------------
Category 1: Forest Service Roads (Grade 2-3)
  - ~350 trails system-wide
  - Gravel/dirt surface
  - Moderate traffic
  - Good hiding locations

Category 2: Ground Surface Trails
  - 1,021 trails with "ground" surface
  - Natural earth, good for burial
  - Examples: Rainbow Road, Graybeard Trail, Old Trestle Road

Category 3: Long-Distance Trails
  - Mountains-to-Sea Trail (multiple segments)
  - Appalachian Trail
  - Well-known for clue creation

CRITICAL ISSUE
--------------
93% of trails (11,106) show "Unknown" county - missing tiger:county tag in OSM

SOLUTION: Use GIS spatial join with county boundary shapefiles to correctly
attribute trails based on coordinates. Will likely reveal 10x more Buncombe trails.

NEXT STEPS FOR OTHER AGENTS
----------------------------
1. Spatial county attribution (GIS boundary join)
2. Property boundary validation (ensure public land)
3. Elevation analysis (filter for moderate terrain)
4. Feature detection (identify landmarks, junctions, bridges)
5. Accessibility scoring (distance from Asheville, trailhead access)
6. Seclusion analysis (research trail popularity)

FILTERING STRATEGY
------------------
PRIORITY 1: Surface = ground/dirt/gravel/unpaved
PRIORITY 2: Difficulty = grade2/grade3/hiking
PRIORITY 3: Type = track (Forest Service roads)
PRIORITY 4: County = Buncombe (after spatial attribution)
PRIORITY 5: Length = 1-5 miles (long enough for options, short enough to scout)

ESTIMATED CANDIDATES AFTER FILTERING
-------------------------------------
Surface filter:       ~1,755 trails (ground/gravel/dirt/unpaved)
+ Difficulty filter:  ~600 trails (grade2-3 or hiking)
+ Type filter:        ~350 trails (tracks/paths)
+ County filter:      ~50-100 trails (Buncombe area, after attribution)
+ Length filter:      ~20-30 trails (1-5 miles)

FINAL SHORTLIST TARGET: 10-20 locations for ground-truthing

DATA QUALITY
------------
Strengths:
  - Complete coordinates for all 11,954 trails
  - Good Forest Service road coverage (509 trails)
  - 45% have surface information
  - 22% have proper names

Limitations:
  - 93% missing county attribution (though coords are accurate)
  - 55% missing surface data
  - 87% missing difficulty data
  - No trail popularity or usage data
