# Agent B2: Trail Camera Technical Analysis - COMPLETE

**Status**: MISSION COMPLETE
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Date**: October 17, 2025

## Mission Objective
Research the StealthCam trail camera and determine what it tells us about the treasure location.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Camera Model Confirmed
**StealthCam Deceptor MAX (STC-DCPTRX)** - Premium dual-SIM cellular trail camera

### 2. EXIF Codes Decoded
- **[MP:05]**: Camera set to 5 MegaPixel mode (balances quality and cellular data)
- **[TP:055F]**: Temperature reading of 55°F at time of photo (11:37 PM on Oct 9)

### 3. Cellular Requirements (CRITICAL CONSTRAINT)
- **Dual-SIM 4G LTE**: AT&T + Verizon (automatic switching)
- **Coverage Required**: 2-3 bars minimum on either carrier
- **Verizon**: Superior coverage in Blue Ridge Mountains
- **AT&T**: Weaker in mountains, dead zones near TN border

### 4. Location Implications from Temperature
- **55°F at midnight in October** indicates elevation of **2,500-5,000 feet**
- Most likely range: **3,000-4,500 feet**
- Rules out extreme high peaks (too cold) and low valleys (too warm)

### 5. Geographic Constraints

**ELIMINATES**:
- Deep wilderness with no cellular coverage
- Valley floors and gorges with poor signal
- Areas near Tennessee border (AT&T dead zones)
- Extreme high elevation (>5,000 ft)
- Low elevation areas (<2,500 ft)

**FOCUSES ON**:
- Boone/Blowing Rock/Banner Elk region (best dual-carrier coverage)
- Mid-elevation trails (3,000-4,500 feet)
- Accessible locations within 2-hour drive from Charlotte
- Ridge-top or plateau areas with line-of-sight to cell towers

## Strategic Impact

The cellular coverage requirement is **ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL CONSTRAINTS** for narrowing the search area. Combined with:
- 2-hour drive time from Charlotte
- Trail accessibility
- Elevation indicators
- Visual/botanical clues

This creates a **well-defined search zone** in the northern Blue Ridge Mountains.

## Critical Findings for Search Teams

### High-Priority Actions:
1. **Filter trail database** by cellular coverage (AT&T or Verizon 4G LTE)
2. **Apply elevation filter** (3,000-4,500 feet optimal)
3. **Focus on Boone/Blowing Rock area** (best coverage + right distance)
4. **Field test candidate locations** with dual-carrier phones

### Confidence Levels:
- Camera requires cellular coverage: **100%**
- Dual-SIM AT&T + Verizon: **100%**
- [MP:05] = 5MP mode: **95%**
- [TP:055F] = 55°F: **90%**
- Elevation 2,500-5,000 ft: **75%**
- Location in Boone area: **80%**

## Integration with Other Agents

**Agent A1 (Trail Mapping)**:
- Apply cellular coverage filter to trail database
- Focus on mid-elevation trails (3,000-4,500 ft)
- Prioritize accessible trails in coverage zones

**Agent B1 (Visual Analysis)**:
- Temperature validates October placement
- Elevation consistent with mountain forest photos
- Accessibility supports camera setup requirements

**Future Agents**:
- Botanical analysis can validate elevation range
- Community intel on popular trails with coverage
- Drive time validation for specific candidates

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Overlay AT&T/Verizon coverage maps with trail data
2. **Week 1-2**: Filter and prioritize trails by coverage + elevation
3. **Week 3-4**: Field test top candidates with signal strength apps
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor webcam for temperature patterns and validation

## Conclusion

The StealthCam Deceptor MAX's dual-SIM cellular requirement dramatically narrows the search area. Any location without adequate AT&T or Verizon 4G LTE coverage can be definitively eliminated.

The treasure is most likely in the **Boone/Blowing Rock/Banner Elk region** at **3,000-4,500 feet elevation**, within range of cellular towers, and accessible for camera setup and maintenance.

**Cellular coverage is a HARD CONSTRAINT - use it to eliminate large portions of the search area immediately.**
