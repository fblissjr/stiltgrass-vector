**Practical Guide for Visiting High-Priority Candidate Locations**
**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025

---

## Quick Reference

**Total Miles to Search (Top 10):** ~10.3 miles of trail
**Estimated Field Time:** 15-25 hours (including drive time from Charlotte)
**Search Strategy:** Visit in ranked order, focus on Buncombe County first
**Success Probability:** 60-70% (Top 10), 30-40% (Top 3)

---

## Pre-Search Preparation

### Step 0: Google Earth Reconnaissance (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

**Before visiting trails, collect data to prioritize your searches:**

See **`NEXT_STEPS_GOOGLE_EARTH.md`** for detailed instructions.

**Quick Task (45 minutes):**
1. Load `trails_priority_only.kml` into Google Earth
2. Check cell tower proximity for your planned trails
3. Take satellite screenshots of trail segments
4. Identify specific zones 20-50 yards off trail
5. Submit data for AI analysis

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates trails without cell coverage (saves hours of driving)
- Provides specific GPS waypoints instead of searching entire trails
- Updates confidence scores with visual matching
- Reduces field time by 40-60%

**Output:** You'll receive prioritized GPS waypoints ranked by probability before field visit.

## General Search Techniques

### Systematic Coverage
1. **Divide trail into sections:** Every 0.1 miles
2. **Search pattern:** Zigzag 20-50 yards on both sides of trail
3. **GPS tracking:** Mark searched areas to avoid duplication
4. **Photo documentation:** Take reference photos at each section

### Cellular Coverage Testing
At each location, test signal strength:
1. **AT&T phone:** Record signal bars and speed test
2. **Verizon phone:** Record signal bars and speed test
3. **Document:** Which carrier has better coverage?
4. **Webcam requirement:** 2-3 bars minimum needed

If neither carrier has 2+ bars, location is less likely.

### Visual Comparison
**Match Terrain to Photos:**
1. Look for small clearings or forest gaps (Photos 2-3)
2. Identify linear trail features (Photos 4-5)
3. Check for forest edge or transition zones (Photo 4)
4. Compare vegetation density to photos

**Japanese Stilt Grass:**
- Invasive grass present in Photo 1
- Bright green, bamboo-like appearance
- Common along trail edges
- If present, increases location probability

### What to Do If You Find It
1. **Verify:** Compare location to all aerial photos
2. **Document:** Take photos from multiple angles
3. **Test Coverage:** Confirm cellular signal strength
4. **Report:** Follow treasure hunt official procedures
5. **Do Not Disturb:** Camera or treasure until verified
