# Incomplete Work

**Approaches we started but never finished.**

These documents represent work that was planned or partially executed before the treasure was found by someone else. They're preserved here for educational purposes - showing both what was attempted and what might have helped if completed.

## Context

The treasure was found on Day 11 using cloud shadow analysis. Our AI analysis was still in progress. These documents represent next steps we had planned but never executed.

## Files

### `google-earth-workflow.md`
**Manual satellite imagery analysis workflow**

A detailed procedure for:
- Downloading satellite imagery from Google Earth
- Comparing to aerial photos visually
- Identifying candidate locations
- Validating cell tower proximity

**Why incomplete:** Treasure was found before we could execute this.

**Educational value:** Shows how to design manual verification workflows when automated approaches aren't sufficient.

---

### `google-earth-data.md`
**Data collection procedures for Google Earth**

Specific instructions for:
- Screenshot collection methodology
- Coordinate recording
- Layer management in Google Earth Pro
- Historical imagery comparison

**Why incomplete:** Never executed.

**Educational value:** Detailed operational procedures for geospatial analysis.

---

### `gemini-queries.md`
**Queries designed for Google's Gemini AI**

Prompts and queries for:
- Analyzing satellite imagery with multimodal AI
- Extracting features from aerial photos
- Comparing visual signatures

**Why incomplete:** Experimental approach, never fully tested.

**Educational value:** Shows how to design prompts for multimodal AI analysis of geospatial data.

## What Might Have Helped

If we had completed the Google Earth workflow, we might have:
- Validated cell tower proximity for each candidate
- Compared satellite imagery to aerial photos visually
- Noticed the Madison County cluster near the search center
- Identified Red Trail as a high-priority candidate

**But we'll never know** - the temporal webcam analysis (cloud shadows) proved more effective than any static imagery approach.

## The Lesson

Sometimes the best approach isn't more sophisticated analysis of the same data - it's finding a different data source entirely (webcam archives vs trail database).
