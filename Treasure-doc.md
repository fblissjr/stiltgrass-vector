### What is Countdown Treasure?
Website: https://countdowntreasure.com/treasure-hunt

Countdown Treasure is a real-world treasure hunt where 25,350 in actual gold coins – plus a side pot for the ultimate winner that grows by $10 from every premium hunter who joins – sits waiting to be discovered in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Unlike traditional treasure hunts, this treasure:

Is placed in plain sight on the forest floor and monitored 24/7 by a live streaming camera on the website.

Operates on a unique "countdown" system. On Day 1 the treasure’s search radius is 420 miles. Every day after that at 9am ET the search area shrinks and the website is updated. If we got to the final day the search area would be only 1 foot in diameter. The treasure is 100% guaranteed to be found in at most 3 weeks.

Everyone can follow along with the live webcam feed and daily map updates. Premium hunters receive exclusive aerial photos that are a combination of drone and satellite photographs taken from increasing altitudes that shows more and more of the surrounding area and access to the private members-only community.

### Treasure Hunt Information
- Public land only – The treasure is hidden on publicly accessible land in the Blue Ridge Mountains, no more than 50 yards off a hiking trail. It won’t be right on the trail (so random hikers won’t stumble on it), and it won’t be in sensitive ecological areas. The spot will be easy to reach — just regular forest floor directly off the trail, as shown in aerial photos. If the treasure were taller, you could see it from the trail. Please do not trespass while searching.
- Physical requirements - requires moderate hiking off-trail (not wheelchair accessible).
- Does finding the treasure involve going off-trail?
  Yes, you will need to hike off established trails. The treasure was not placed directly on a trail, as that would make it too likely for casual hikers to discover it. Bring proper navigation equipment (GPS, compass) to find your way back.
- What about trespassing?
  The treasure has been placed on public land where treasure hunting is permitted. No trespassing is required or allowed. Respect all private property boundaries.
- Daily aerial photos that were taken by drone can be found in Aerial Photos subheading
- All daily aerial photos were taken by drone on October 8th and the hunt started on October 9th
The center point may shift slightly as the circle shrinks, but the new circle is always fully contained within the previous day's circle. The treasure never moves outside the previous boundary. But it's also never in the center of the circle… or is it?
