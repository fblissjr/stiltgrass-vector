## Satellite Imagery Search Strategy

### Step-by-Step Google Earth Inspection Protocol

#### Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance
For each trail, perform these steps:

1. **Open Google Earth** (web: earth.google.com/web/ or desktop application)

2. **Navigate to coordinates:**
   - Enter GPS coordinates in search box
   - Or search by trail name + location

3. **Set optimal view:**
   - Switch to Satellite View (if not default)
   - Zoom to eye altitude: 1,500-3,000 feet
   - Tilt: 0° (straight down for best trail visibility)

4. **Enable terrain features:**
   - Turn on "Terrain" layer if available
   - Enable "3D Buildings" (off) for clearer view

5. **Check image date:**
   - Look for image capture date (usually bottom of screen)
   - Prefer imagery from spring/fall for deciduous contrast
   - Avoid winter (leaves off) or summer (dense canopy)

#### Phase 2: Trail Feature Detection

For each identified trail corridor:

1. **Width measurement:**
   - Use measurement tool (ruler icon)
   - Measure perpendicular to trail direction
   - Target: 3-6 feet for match, 8-15 feet for forest road

2. **Color analysis:**
   - Look for brown/tan linear corridor
   - Should contrast with surrounding green vegetation
   - Gray = gravel/paved (less likely)
   - Brown/tan = bare dirt (more likely)

3. **Orientation check:**
   - Use compass tool
   - Measure trail bearing
   - Target: 0-15° (N-S) or 165-180° (NW-SE)

4. **Forest type verification:**
   - Zoom out to canopy level (photos 7-8 altitude)
   - Check canopy color: Light yellow-green = deciduous (good)
   - Dark green = evergreen (exclude)
   - Patchy = mixed (possible)

5. **Context clues:**
   - Look for trail intersections
   - Identify parking areas/trailheads
   - Check for cell towers nearby (webcam requirement)
   - Verify public land boundaries if possible

#### Phase 3: Detailed Comparison

For trails that pass Phase 1-2 screening:

1. **Screenshot capture:**
   - Take high-resolution screenshot of trail segment
   - Include scale bar and north arrow
   - Note GPS coordinates in filename

2. **Multi-altitude analysis:**
   - View at 500 feet (detail)
   - View at 2,000 feet (context)
   - View at 5,000 feet (landscape)
   - Compare to aerial photos 4-6-8 progression

3. **Historical imagery:**
   - Use "Historical Imagery" tool (clock icon)
   - Check multiple years for consistency
   - Trail should be visible across multiple years
   - Look for seasonal changes in deciduous canopy

4. **3D perspective:**
   - Tilt view to 45-60° angle
   - Rotate around trail location
   - Assess terrain (flat areas or slopes - orientation not confirmed as constraint)
   - Visualize accessibility from trail to 50 yards off

## Comparison Matrix: Satellite vs. Aerial Photos

### Critical Matching Criteria

| Criteria | Aerial Photos 4-6 | Satellite Requirements | Weight |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Trail width** | 3-6 feet | 1-2 pixels @ 1m resolution | HIGH |
| **Trail surface** | Bare dirt, brown/tan | RGB(140,120,90) range | CRITICAL |
| **Trail orientation** | Variable | Cannot confirm from photos | LOW |
| **Trail pattern** | Linear w/ gentle curves | Consistent corridor | MEDIUM |
| **Vegetation** | Dense green understory | High NDVI on both sides | HIGH |
| **Canopy type** | Deciduous dominant | Light yellow-green | CRITICAL |
| **Canopy density** | 50-80% coverage | Partial openings visible | MEDIUM |
| **Trail edges** | Distinct but irregular | Sharp color boundary | MEDIUM |
| **Length visible** | >50 feet | Multiple pixels | HIGH |

### Resolution Requirements

For reliable trail detection in satellite imagery:

| Resolution | Trail Width in Pixels | Visibility | Source |
|------------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| 0.3m (WorldView-3) | 3-6 pixels | Excellent | Commercial |
| 0.5m (Pleiades) | 2-4 pixels | Good | Commercial |
| 1.0m (GeoEye) | 1-2 pixels | Fair | Google Earth |
| 3.0m (Planet) | <1 pixel | Poor | Public |

**Google Earth typically uses 1m resolution** in populated areas, degrading to 3-15m in remote forests.

**Implication:** Narrow trails (3-6 feet) may be at detection limit in Google Earth imagery for remote forest areas.

## Technical Analysis: Satellite Detection Probability

### Trail Visibility Modeling

Based on aerial photo characteristics and typical Google Earth resolution:

#### Detection Probability Matrix

| Trail | Width (ft) | Surface | Canopy | Resolution Needed | Google Earth Adequate? | Probability |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Old Trestle Road | 5-8 | Bare dirt | Deciduous | 1m | Yes (likely) | **75%** |
| Bent Creek Trail | 8-15 | Gravel | Deciduous | 1m | Yes (definite) | **90%** (but surface mismatch) |
| Rainbow Road | 6-10 | Bare dirt | Deciduous | 1m | Yes (possible) | **60%** |

**Key Finding:** All top trails should be visible in Google Earth satellite imagery, BUT visual signature match varies significantly.

### Limiting Factors

1. **Image Resolution:**
   - Google Earth uses ~1m resolution in NC mountain areas
   - 3-6 foot trails = 1-2 pixels wide (marginal detection)
   - 8-15 foot roads = 3-5 pixels wide (good detection)

2. **Canopy Coverage:**
   - Deciduous forest in October = partial leaf coverage
   - 50-80% canopy = trail may be obscured in sections
   - Need to scan entire trail length for gaps

3. **Image Acquisition Date:**
   - Best: Late fall or early spring (minimal leaf cover)
   - Worst: Mid-summer (full canopy)
   - Google Earth images may be multiple years old

4. **Shadow Effects:**
   - North-south trails = even illumination (good)
   - East-west trails = shadows can obscure detail (bad)
   - Slope orientation cannot be confirmed from available photos (removed as constraint)

## Automated Detection Strategy

### For Advanced Users with GIS Software

If you have access to high-resolution satellite imagery and GIS tools (QGIS, ArcGIS, ENVI):

#### Workflow for Automated Trail Detection

```python
# Pseudocode for satellite trail detection

# 1. Load high-resolution satellite image (0.3-1m resolution)
satellite_image = load_image("area_of_interest.tif")

# 2. Convert to HSV color space
hsv_image = rgb_to_hsv(satellite_image)

# 3. Create vegetation mask
vegetation_mask = apply_thresholds(hsv_image,
    hue_range=(30, 85),
    saturation_range=(60, 255),
    value_range=(60, 255)
)

# 4. Create bare ground mask
bare_ground_mask = apply_thresholds(hsv_image,
    hue_range=(0, 30),
    saturation_range=(0, 80),
    value_range=(80, 200)
)

# 5. Find linear features (trails) in bare ground
edges = canny_edge_detection(bare_ground_mask)
lines = hough_line_transform(edges,
    min_length=50_feet,
    max_gap=10_feet
)

# 6. Filter by geometric constraints
trails = filter_lines(lines,
    width_range=(3, 8),  # feet
    orientation=(0, 15) OR (165, 180),  # degrees
    length_min=50,  # feet
    curvature_max=0.3  # gentle curves only
)

# 7. Verify forest context
for trail in trails:
    canopy = analyze_canopy(satellite_image, trail.buffer(50))
    if canopy.type == "deciduous" and canopy.coverage > 50%:
        trail.confidence = HIGH
    else:
        trail.confidence = LOW

# 8. Export candidates
export_to_kml(trails, "trail_candidates.kml")
```

**Note:** This requires commercial satellite imagery (WorldView, Pleiades) with 0.3-0.5m resolution for reliable 3-6 foot trail detection.

## Updated Rankings Based on Satellite Assessment

### Revised Priority Order (Incorporating Visual Match Potential)

| New Rank | Trail | Original Rank | Score | Confidence | Visual Match | Priority |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **1** | **Old Trestle Road (all segments)** | 2, 3, 5 | 125 | MEDIUM-HIGH | 8/10 | **HIGHEST** |
| 2 | Bent Creek Trail (FS 480A) | 1 | 125 | MEDIUM | 5/10 | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Rainbow Road | 4 | 125 | LOW-MEDIUM | 6/10 | LOW |

### Rationale for Re-Ranking

**Old Trestle Road moved to #1 because:**
1. **Surface type matches:** Ground/bare dirt vs. gravel
2. **Width more appropriate:** 5-8 feet railroad grade vs. 8-15 feet FS road
3. **Historic feature:** Railroad grades are highly visible from satellite
4. **Multiple segments:** Increases probability of finding match
5. **Visual signature alignment:** Brown dirt corridor through green forest

**Bent Creek Trail demoted to #2 despite original #1 rank because:**
1. **Critical surface mismatch:** Gravel vs. bare dirt in photos
2. **Width likely too wide:** FS roads typically 10-15 feet
3. **Visual signature mismatch:** Gray gravel vs. brown dirt

**Rainbow Road remains #3 because:**
1. **Private property concern:** May violate contest rules
2. **Shorter trail:** Less area to search
3. **Same trail system:** Covered by Old Trestle Road inspection

   - Only trailhead coordinates available for some trails
   - Trail corridors may span significant distance
   - Exact treasure location unknown within trail areas

3. **Image Resolution Unknown:**
   - Cannot verify Google Earth image quality for specific locations
   - Resolution may be inadequate for 3-6 foot trail detection
   - Image dates unknown (may be outdated)

4. **Canopy Interference:**
   - Deciduous forest with 50-80% coverage
   - Trail may be partially obscured
   - Seasonal variation in visibility

5. **Time Constraints:**
   - Comprehensive manual inspection requires 2-4 hours per trail
   - Historical imagery review not performed
   - 3D terrain analysis not conducted

### What Would Improve This Analysis

**Ideal Resources:**
1. Commercial satellite imagery (0.3-0.5m resolution)
2. Multi-temporal analysis (multiple years/seasons)
3. LiDAR data (penetrates canopy to show ground features)
4. Infrared imagery (highlights bare soil vs. vegetation)
5. Direct Google Earth Pro access with measurement tools
6. Field-validated ground truth data

## Conclusions & Recommendations

### Key Takeaways

1. **Old Trestle Road is the strongest candidate** for visual satellite matching based on:
   - Ground surface (matches photos)
   - Appropriate width (railroad grade)
   - Historic linear feature (visible from above)
   - Well-documented location

2. **Bent Creek Trail remains important** despite surface mismatch because:
   - Highest algorithmic score
   - Confirmed public land
   - May have foot trails branching from main road

3. **All top trails should be visible** in Google Earth with careful inspection:
   - 1m resolution adequate for roads/wide trails
   - Marginal for narrow 3-6 foot trails
   - Requires systematic scanning

4. **Manual inspection is essential:**
   - Automated scoring cannot assess visual signature
   - Human pattern recognition needed for trail identification
   - Multiple factors must be evaluated simultaneously

### Final Recommendations

#### For Satellite Imagery Analysis:

1. **Invest 2-3 hours in thorough Google Earth inspection** of Old Trestle Road system
2. **Download GPS tracks** from HikeWNC, Trailforks, AllTrails
3. **Compare aerial photos 4-6 directly** with satellite screenshots
4. **Create side-by-side visual comparison** for best match assessment

#### For Field Verification:

1. **Start with Old Trestle Road** (highest visual match probability)
2. **Bring printed satellite screenshots** for orientation
3. **Systematic search protocol:** Walk trail, check 50-yard buffers at promising locations
4. **Use aerial photos** as ground truth for vegetation matching

#### For Expanding Search:

If top 5 trails inconclusive:
1. **Check ranks 6-10** from trail verification report
2. **Consider trails with "ground" surface** prioritized over "gravel"
3. **Look for railroad grades** and historic routes (visible from satellite)
4. **Filter for 0.5-2.0 mile lengths** (manageable search)
