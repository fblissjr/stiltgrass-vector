## SCORING GUIDE

### Count Your Checkmarks

**9-12 checks:** HIGH CONFIDENCE
- Take multiple screenshots
- Mark exact GPS coordinates
- Plan immediate field verification

**6-8 checks:** MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
- Take screenshots
- Include in field verification list
- Consider additional research

**0-5 checks:** LOW CONFIDENCE
- Document as "no match"
- Move to next location
- Try alternate trails from ranks 6-10

## COMPARISON PHOTOS

### Photo 4 (Mid-Altitude) - What Trail Looks Like
- Brown/tan bare dirt surface
- 3-6 feet wide
- Linear corridor
- Dense green on both sides
- Natural irregular edges

### Photo 5 (Higher) - Trail in Context
- Same brown corridor
- Begins to see surrounding terrain
- Trail orientation visible (N-S or NW-SE)
- Forest canopy starting to appear

### Photo 6 (High) - Trail and Forest
- Trail still visible as brown line
- Deciduous canopy around trail
- 50-80% canopy coverage
- Light yellow-green tree color

### Photos 7-8 (Canopy) - Forest Type
- Light yellow-green deciduous canopy
- NOT dark green evergreen
- Partial openings in canopy
- October color (light, not dark)

## QUICK DECISION TREE

```
Can you see a linear feature?
│
├─ NO → Try different zoom/angle or move to next location
│
└─ YES → Is it brown/tan colored?
    │
    ├─ NO (gray/white) → Likely gravel/paved, not a match
    │
    └─ YES → Is it 3-8 feet wide?
        │
        ├─ NO (too wide) → Likely vehicle road, not a match
        │
        └─ YES → Is forest light green (deciduous)?
            │
            ├─ NO (dark green) → Wrong forest type, not a match
            │
            └─ YES → HIGH CONFIDENCE MATCH!
                     Take screenshots & mark coordinates
```

## MEASUREMENTS

### Use Google Earth Ruler Tool

**Trail Width:**
- Measure perpendicular to trail
- Target: 3-8 feet (1-2.5 meters)
- Less than 3 feet: Too narrow
- More than 10 feet: Too wide (likely road)

**Trail Orientation:**
- Use compass tool
- Target: 0-15° (N-S) OR 165-180° (NW-SE)
- Other orientations: Possible but lower confidence

**Trail Length:**
- Measure visible segment
- Target: At least 50 feet (15 meters) continuously visible
- Longer = better (more searchable area)

## SCREENSHOT CHECKLIST

For each promising location:
```
[  ] Scale bar visible
[  ] Coordinates displayed or noted
[  ] Eye altitude recorded
[  ] Trail feature centered
[  ] North arrow (if available)
[  ] Image date noted (if visible)
[  ] Multiple zoom levels captured
```

**Save as:** `trailname_lat_lon.png`
**Location:** `/Users/fredbliss/workspace/treasure/data/satellite_imagery/`

## TIME BUDGET

- **5 minutes:** Quick scan of all 3 locations
- **15 minutes:** Detailed inspection with basic screenshots
- **30 minutes:** Systematic search with measurements
- **60 minutes:** Comprehensive analysis with comparison

**Recommended:** Start with 15 minutes

---

## WHAT TO DO WITH RESULTS

### If HIGH Confidence Match:
1. Save screenshots to `data/satellite_imagery/`
2. Note exact GPS coordinates
3. Measure trail width and orientation
4. Compare side-by-side with aerial photos
5. Plan field verification route

### If MEDIUM Confidence:
1. Save screenshots
2. Note uncertainties (color? width? forest type?)
3. Mark for possible field verification
4. Continue checking other locations

### If NO Match:
1. Document negative result
2. Move to next priority location
3. Consider expanding to ranks 6-10 trails

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Brown dirt, not gray gravel** - Most important discriminator
2. **3-8 feet wide, not 10-15 feet** - Width is critical
3. **Light green deciduous, not dark evergreen** - Forest type matters
4. **Look for N-S or NW-SE orientation** - Matches photo evidence
5. **Take screenshots of everything** - Document for later comparison

## SUCCESS = FINDING THIS:

> "A 3-8 foot wide brown/tan dirt trail running roughly north-south through light green deciduous forest, visible continuously for at least 50 feet in Google Earth satellite imagery."

**If you find this → HIGH priority for field verification**
**If you don't find this → Try next coordinates or expand search**
