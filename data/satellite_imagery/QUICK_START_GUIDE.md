# Google Earth Quick Start Guide
## 5-Minute Trail Inspection Protocol

**Mission:** Visually inspect top trails in Google Earth to identify matches with aerial photos

---

## FASTEST PATH TO RESULTS

### 1. Open Google Earth
- Web: https://earth.google.com/web/
- Desktop: Launch Google Earth Pro (if installed)

### 2. Search These Coordinates (In Order)

#### PRIORITY 1: Old Trestle Road
```
35.6397, -82.2944
```
**What to look for:**
- Brown/tan linear corridor (railroad grade)
- Width: 5-8 feet
- Runs through green forest
- Should be clearly visible

**Why this is #1:**
- Ground surface matches aerial photos perfectly
- Historic railroad grade = high visibility
- Well-documented location

---

#### PRIORITY 2: Bent Creek
```
35.4999, -82.6031
```
**What to look for:**
- Gray/tan gravel road (wider than photos)
- Look for side trails (brown dirt)
- Forest Service road network

**Note:** May be TOO WIDE (gravel road vs. dirt trail)

---

#### PRIORITY 3: Montreat Area
```
35.639, -82.294
```
**What to look for:**
- Rainbow Road and other trail connections
- Doubletrack trails

**Note:** Private property - lower priority

---

## 3. Visual Checklist (30 seconds per location)

For each coordinate, check:

- [ ] Can you see a linear brown/tan trail?
- [ ] Is it 3-8 feet wide? (measure with ruler tool)
- [ ] Does it run roughly North-South?
- [ ] Is the forest light green (deciduous) not dark green (evergreen)?
- [ ] Take screenshot if YES to all above

---

## 4. Screenshot & Save

**Filename format:** `trailname_lat_lon.png`

Save to: `data/satellite_imagery/`

**Include in screenshot:**
- Scale bar (turn on in View menu)
- Coordinates visible
- North arrow

---

## 5. Compare to Aerial Photos

Open these side-by-side:
- `photos/04_aerial.jpg`
- `photos/05_aerial.jpg`
- `photos/06_aerial.jpg`

**Look for match:**
- Similar width (3-6 feet)
- Brown dirt color (not gray gravel)
- Dense green vegetation on both sides
- Linear pattern with gentle curves

---

## WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

### From Photos 4-6 (Mid-Altitude):
- **Trail color:** Brown/tan (bare dirt)
- **Trail width:** 3-6 feet (about 2 adult steps)
- **Trail pattern:** Straight to gently curving
- **Orientation:** North-South or Northwest-Southeast
- **Surroundings:** Dense green forest, deciduous trees

### From Photos 7-8 (High Altitude):
- **Canopy color:** Light yellow-green (October deciduous)
- **NOT dark green** (evergreen conifers)
- **Canopy density:** 50-80% coverage (can see some ground)

---

## RESULTS INTERPRETATION

### HIGH MATCH
If you see a trail that:
- ✓ Brown/tan color (not gray)
- ✓ 3-8 feet wide
- ✓ Runs N-S or NW-SE
- ✓ Through deciduous forest
- ✓ Visible for 50+ feet

**Action:** Mark GPS coordinates, take multiple screenshots, HIGH priority for field visit

### MEDIUM MATCH
If you see a trail but:
- ~ Color uncertain (shadows/image quality)
- ~ Width seems right but hard to measure
- ~ Forest type matches
- ~ Partially obscured by canopy

**Action:** Mark as possible, take screenshots, MEDIUM priority

### LOW MATCH / NO MATCH
If you see:
- ✗ Gravel road (gray color)
- ✗ Too wide (>10 feet)
- ✗ Paved road
- ✗ Evergreen forest (dark green)
- ✗ No visible trail at all

**Action:** Document as "no match", move to next location

---

## TIME BUDGET

- **5 minutes:** Quick scan of all 3 priority locations
- **15 minutes:** Detailed inspection with screenshots
- **30 minutes:** Systematic scan of trail lengths
- **60 minutes:** Full analysis with measurements and comparison

**Recommended:** Start with 15-minute inspection to get quick results.

## TOOLS TO USE IN GOOGLE EARTH

### Essential:
1. **Search box** - Enter coordinates
2. **Zoom slider** - Get to 1,000-3,000 feet altitude
3. **Screenshot** - Capture findings

### Helpful:
4. **Ruler tool** - Measure trail width
5. **Compass** - Check trail orientation
6. **Historical Imagery** - See trail in different years/seasons
7. **3D tilt** - View terrain from angle

### View Settings:
- Switch to **Satellite view**
- Turn on **Terrain**
- Set tilt to **0°** (straight down)
- Zoom to **1,500-2,500 feet** eye altitude

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Best Case:
You find a clear match in Old Trestle Road area:
- Linear brown dirt trail visible
- Matches width and orientation from photos
- Can identify specific GPS coordinates
- Ready for field verification

### Likely Case:
You find possible matches but unclear:
- Trail partially visible through canopy
- Width/color uncertain due to image resolution
- Need field verification to confirm

### Worst Case:
No clear trails visible:
- Image resolution too low
- Canopy too dense
- Need higher resolution imagery or field search

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER INSPECTION

1. **Update the main report** with findings
2. **Save all screenshots** to satellite_imagery folder
3. **Mark GPS coordinates** of promising locations
4. **Plan field verification** for HIGH priority matches
5. **Expand search** to ranks 6-10 if needed
