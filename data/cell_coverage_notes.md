# Cell Coverage Analysis - Western NC Mountains
## Search Area: Asheville/Pisgah (35.635°N, 82.875°W)

## Summary for Webcam Deployment
**CRITICAL FINDING**: Cell coverage in mountain areas is highly variable. Verizon has best overall coverage, but reliability every 10 minutes is NOT guaranteed in backcountry areas.

## Coverage by Carrier - Buncombe County

### Verizon (BEST CHOICE)
- **Coverage**: 97-99.22% of Buncombe County land area
- **Technology**: Strong 4G LTE (99%), 5G (85%)
- **Mountain Performance**: Best among carriers but still variable
- **Rating**: Best choice for webcam deployment

### AT&T
- **Coverage**: 83.9% of Buncombe County
- **Technology**: 98% 4G LTE, only 3% 5G in Asheville area
- **Mountain Performance**: Gets considerably weaker north of Asheville and Black Mountain
- **Dead Zones**: Areas near Black Mountain, closer to Tennessee state line
- **Rating**: Secondary choice

### T-Mobile
- **Coverage**: 69.4% of Buncombe County land area (96.45% 5G where available)
- **Technology**: Best speeds where signal exists, 99.32% 5G in Asheville city
- **Mountain Performance**: Weak outside major cities
- **Dead Zones**: Several across state, areas south of Black Mountain
- **Rating**: Not recommended for backcountry

## Terrain-Specific Patterns

### Good Coverage Areas:
- Ridges and gaps facing towns
- Higher elevations with open views
- Areas closer to Asheville
- Southern parts of Buncombe County

### Poor Coverage Areas:
- Valleys and hollows
- Dense forest canopy areas
- Areas shielded by mountain peaks
- Northeastern Buncombe County
- Blue Ridge Parkway (no cell towers by design)

### Coverage Volatility:
- Can range from 1-4 bars within a few hundred feet
- Drops in and out between mountain peaks
- No cell towers along Blue Ridge Parkway itself

## Recommendations for Webcam Placement

### HIGH PRIORITY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. **Test Before Deployment**: Must test actual signal at exact location
2. **Choose Ridge Locations**: Prefer ridges/gaps with town-facing views
3. **Avoid Valleys**: Deep hollows will have poor/no signal
4. **Verizon Strongly Recommended**: 97%+ coverage vs 69-84% for others
5. **Signal Booster**: Consider cellular signal booster for marginal locations
6. **Backup Plan**: May need multiple site evaluations

### Best Trail Types for Coverage:
- Trails along Blue Ridge Parkway with southern exposures
- Popular trailheads near Asheville (within 10-15 miles)
- Trails on ridge systems rather than creek valleys
- Areas with existing parking lots (suggests proximity to civilization)

### Worst Trail Types for Coverage:
- Remote backcountry trails 20+ miles from towns
- Creek valley trails in deep hollows
- North-facing slopes away from Asheville
- Areas near Tennessee border

## Post-Hurricane Helene Note
As of October 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant cell service disruptions. Most services have been restored, but some lingering dead zones may persist. Verify current conditions before deployment.

## Testing Protocol Recommendation
1. Visit potential sites with Verizon device
2. Test signal at proposed camera height (6-8 ft)
3. Check signal stability over 1 hour minimum
4. Verify uploads work, not just signal bars
5. Test during different weather conditions if possible
