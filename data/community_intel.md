- **Location theories**: Not publicly discussed in accessible forums
- **Reddit activity**: Minimal to none found
- **Public discussion**: Limited - likely kept private in premium community

### Challenges Noted:

- Bears present in area

## Strategic Intelligence

### Hunt Type Analysis:
- **No riddles**: Pure location-based hunt
- **Visual clues only**: Webcam + drone photos
- **Time pressure**: Daily shrinking circle
- **Technology dependent**: Webcam requires cell coverage at location

### Likely Search Area Characteristics:
Based on constraints:
1. Popular hiking area (public land, good access)
2. Near Charlotte influence (creator is from Charlotte)
3. Within 2-3 hour drive from Charlotte (for webcam maintenance)
4. Good cell coverage (webcam updates every 10 minutes)
5. Popular trail with parking (not 10+ mile hike)
6. Asheville/Pisgah area likely (Blue Ridge Mountains, Helene relief focus)

### Premium Member Advantages:
- Earlier access to daily drone photos
- Community access (potential info sharing)
- Aerial photos
- Support search area narrowing

## Sponsors & Local Business Ties

3. Discord discussions not accessible without membership
