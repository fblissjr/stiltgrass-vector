# Satellite Imagery Quick Reference Card

## Critical Search Parameters (From Photo Analysis)

### Trail Characteristics
- **Width**: 3-6 feet (0.9-1.8 meters)
- **Surface**: Bare dirt/ground (brown/tan color)
- **Pattern**: Linear with gentle curves
- **Orientation**: N-S to NW-SE direction

### At Different Satellite Resolutions

| Resolution | Trail Width | Appearance |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| 0.3m (WorldView-3) | 3-6 pixels | Clearly visible brown line |
| 0.5m (Pleiades) | 2-4 pixels | Visible brown line |
| 1m (GeoEye) | 1-2 pixels | Narrow brown line |
| 3m (Planet) | <1 pixel | May be too narrow |

**Recommendation**: Use 0.3-1m resolution imagery

### Color Signatures (RGB)

```
Trail (bare ground):    RGB(140, 120, 90)  - brown/tan
Vegetation (understory): RGB(80, 120, 60)   - medium green
Canopy (deciduous):     RGB(110, 140, 80)  - yellow-green
```

### HSV Ranges for Automated Detection

```
Bare Ground/Trail:
  H: 0-30°
  S: 0-80
  V: 80-200

Vegetation:
  H: 30-85°
  S: 60-255
  V: 60-255
```

### Forest Context
- **Type**: Deciduous dominant (NOT evergreen)
- **Canopy Color**: Light yellow-green
- **Coverage**: 50-80% canopy
- **Understory**: Dense with Japanese stilt grass

### Spatial Filters

1. **Linear feature detection**: Look for lines 3-6 feet wide
2. **Color contrast ratio**: Brown trail should be 30-40% darker than surrounding green
3. **Edge detection**: Strong edges on both sides of trail
4. **Orientation filter**: Prefer N-S to NW-SE alignments

### Search Strategy Priority

1. Filter deciduous forests FIRST (exclude dark green evergreen)
2. Apply linear feature detection (Hough transform)
3. Filter by trail width (3-6 feet)
4. Verify color contrast (brown vs green)
5. Check orientation (N-S to NW-SE)
6. Validate with slope analysis (south-facing preferred)

### Key Visual Indicators

- Brown/tan LINEAR corridor
- Dense GREEN vegetation on both sides
- Trail edges DISTINCT but IRREGULAR
- Light YELLOW-GREEN canopy above
- Width consistent at 3-6 feet
- NOT paved, NOT gravel - BARE DIRT

### Reference Images

- `trail_features_detected.png` - Edge detection examples
- `photo_progression_overview.png` - Full altitude sequence

### Dominant Trail Angles (Image Coordinates)

Photo 4: 165-180° (NW-SE diagonal)
Photo 5: 0-15° and 165-180° (N-S corridor)
Photo 6: 0-15° and 165-180° (N-S corridor)

**Note**: Image coordinates may differ from map coordinates by camera orientation

### Spectral Analysis Tips

If using multispectral imagery:
- **NDVI**: Trail should show LOW values (bare ground)
- **NDVI**: Surrounding vegetation should show HIGH values
- **Contrast**: Look for sharp NDVI gradient at trail edges
- **NIR band**: Vegetation bright, trail dark
- **Red band**: Trail relatively bright (exposed soil)

### Confidence Indicators

HIGH confidence if satellite image shows:
- Linear feature 3-6 feet wide
- Brown/tan color (RGB ~140,120,90)
- Dense green vegetation surrounding
- Deciduous canopy (yellow-green, not dark green)
- N-S to NW-SE orientation
- Length >50 feet visible

MEDIUM confidence if:
- Trail partially visible
- Color contrast present but weak
- Width approximately correct
- Forest type matches

LOW confidence if:
- No clear linear feature
- Wrong forest type (evergreen)
- Trail too wide or too narrow
- Wrong color profile

### Automated Detection Pseudocode

```python
# 1. Load satellite image
# 2. Convert to HSV
# 3. Create vegetation mask (H=30-85, S>60)
# 4. Create bare ground mask (H=0-30, S<80)
# 5. Find gaps in vegetation mask
# 6. Apply morphological closing
# 7. Find contours
# 8. Filter by:
#    - Width: 3-6 feet (1-6 pixels depending on resolution)
#    - Length: >50 feet
#    - Elongation: length/width > 10
#    - Orientation: within N-S to NW-SE range
# 9. Verify color profile matches brown/tan
# 10. Check forest type (deciduous indicators)
```

### Cross-Reference Data

For additional context, combine with:
- Slope analysis (south-facing preference)
- Trail databases (known hiking trails in area)
- Historical imagery (trail may be visible in multiple years)
- Topographic maps (trail likely follows contours)

### Geographic Context (from other agents)

- Location: Southeastern Pennsylvania
- Terrain: Forested hillside
- Slope: South-facing (hypothesis)
- Elevation: Unknown, but sloped
- Forest type: Mature deciduous secondary growth

---

**Key Takeaway**: Look for a 3-6 foot wide brown/tan linear corridor running N-S to NW-SE through dense green deciduous forest with light yellow-green canopy.
