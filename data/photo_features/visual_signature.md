# Visual Signature for Satellite Matching

## Primary Identifiers (Photos 4-6)

- Linear trail features: 300 detected across photos 4-6
- Trail coverage: 6.8% average
- Trail appears as lighter brown/tan corridor through green vegetation

## Satellite Matching Criteria

### What to Look For

- Linear cleared paths (3-6 feet wide)
- Brown/tan trail through dense green vegetation
- Deciduous forest (light green, not dark evergreen)
- South-facing slope orientation
- Forest edges or clearings nearby

### Spectral Signatures

- Vegetation: Green coverage: 60.0%
- Trail: Brown/bare ground: 21.0%

## Matching Strategy

1. Filter by vegetation: deciduous forest (light green)
2. Identify linear features: trails as brown corridors
3. Check trail width: 3-6 feet (1-2 pixels at 1m resolution)
4. Verify slope: south-facing may appear lighter
5. Look for forest edges nearby
6. Match color profiles from photos 4-6
